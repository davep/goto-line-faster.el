# goto-line-faster.el

## Commentary

`goto-line-faster.el` provides a utility function that binds M-g followed by
a number (1 through 9) to an invocation of goto-line with the number
pre-populated in the input in the minibuffer.

I wrote this because I've never liked 'M-g g' as a way to go to a line
number, but I'd like to use some of the other M-g-prefixed key bindings too.
This pretty much gives me the best of both worlds.
