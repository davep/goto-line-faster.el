# goto-line-faster.el

## Commentary

`goto-line-faster.el` provides a utility command that binds M-g followed by
a number (1 through 9) to an invocation of goto-line with the number
pre-populated in the input in the minibuffer.

I wrote this because I've never liked 'M-g g' as a way to go to a line
number, but I'd like to use some of the other M-g-prefixed key bindings too.
This pretty much gives me the best of both worlds.

Please note that this version of the code is very different from [the
original
version](https://github.com/davep/goto-line-faster.el/blob/775ed4916eb8028252db4dae5a0b71d865568638/goto-line-faster.el),
with [@phil-s](https://github.com/phil-s) [providing a much cleaner
approach](https://github.com/davep/goto-line-faster.el/issues/1).
